    Create a class titled <your first name here> ThreeThreads.
        In this class, you are to use three threads to output three types of characters to a text area for display.
            In the first thread, you are to output random letter characters such as a, b, c, d â€¦
            In the second thread, you are to output random number digits such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
            In the third thread, you are to output random characters such as !, @, #, $, %, &, *
        Display a minimum of 10,000 of each of the three sets.
    Write test code that ensures all methods function correctly.
